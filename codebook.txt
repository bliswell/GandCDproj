Data objects of interest:

- Tidy_Average: the goal dataset of the run_analysis.R script.  "Subject"  "Activity" "Metric" "Average"
	- units: I don't know any units for rotation.  Acceleration is in 'g'.  
- activity_labels: the various activities performed
- features: 561 analytics performed on the different sensors measured. 
- keep_col_variables: the 66 mean() and std() analytics desired for the assignment
- Full_Set: 10299 observations of 70 variables, including the 


The dataset includes the following files under the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory:
=========================================
- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 


Inertial Signals are provided with the train and test sets.  They have no value.  They only serve to confuse.
=========================================

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
